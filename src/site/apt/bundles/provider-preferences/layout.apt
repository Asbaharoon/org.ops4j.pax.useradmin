Preferences Storage Layout

  The preferences storage-layout used by the Eclipse implementation is based on a
  single root: this root contains all entries - users as well as groups.

Main Node:

  The main node contains all user and group entries. Groups only differ from users by having a <members> sub-node.
  
  The <members> node holds all member-ids of the group in a map - the value being <basic> or <required>.
